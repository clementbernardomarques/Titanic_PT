# Titanic_PT

Test made before my entrance to hospital Albert Einstein.

The idea of this code is to predict if people would have survived to the catastrophy of Titanic. In order to make this prediction, many passengers data have been given (age, sex, name etc..) with a label telling if this person survived or not. The data are available at this address: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data. 

The notebook that comes in this repository is a summary (in portuguese) of my analysis and my construction of ML model.
